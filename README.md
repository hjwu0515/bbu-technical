Note: I am using a windows, so if you use a mac, you may need to do some things slightly differently, but the overall steps should be the same.

### Part 1: Downloading Files
1. **Download Folder**: Go to main branch and click code button in upper right corner and select download ZIP.
2.  **Extract Files**: Find the location of the .zip folder and right click, then select extract all.

### Part 2: Setting Up
1. **Open Editor**: Open your favorite IDE (I prefer Visual Studio Code).
2. **Open Folder**: Open the project folder in the editor. If you are in VS Code, you can click on File and select Open Folder...
3. **Run on Local Server**: Open index.html and right click on editor, then select Open with Live Server. Make sure your browser supports html5.
